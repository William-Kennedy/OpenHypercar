<h1>OpenHypercar</h1>
<h2>A radio controlled car built to tinker with, built for under Â£200, and pushing for 100kph</h2>
<br>

<h3>Project History</h3>
<p>
The beginning of this story is the end of my last. Between autumn 2023 and 2024 I developed my CAD and basic aerodynamic knowledge by designing 
an aerodynamic shell to my existing cheap chinese radio controlled car. As this was coming to a close I began to brainstorm what to do next.
In the end it came to two options: A.) Do the same type of 3D printed shell for a more powerful existing RC car or B.) Design a RC car from scratch to be 3D printed.
I chose the later, hoping to develop my CAD skills further and build something more unique and better looking in a CV. I spent literally every last pound of my money to
aquire the elctronics needed for such a project and began to undertake this immense task. Since then progress has been meandering but noticeable. 
I've made the choice to use 3D Printing to accomplish as musch as possible, that way eliminating more expensive hardware.
For example, the use of 3D printed flexure suspension eliminated the need for expensive scale coil overs.

<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>
1st January 2025 - Began to purchase parts and started project officially

April ~ May 2025 - Finished V1 of the car, Major milestone as so much had been learnt about basic mechanical engineering already, despite only having tested
the wheels.
