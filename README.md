# OpenHypercar
Github for the open source radio controlled hypercar I build in my spare time. If you've somehow found this and are interested, please email me williamjeremykennedy@gmail.com 
I'm a secondary school student so free time and finances are low. 
Therefore, the aim of the project is to build a radio controlled car from scratch for under Â£200. It's an attempt to make high performance rc cars more accessible.
Similar to indeterminate design's RC hypercar one of the key features is some serious aerodynamics, since this is the field I am most interested in. 
I'm using two low cost low KV drone motors as a drive train with no software differantial as of yet.
